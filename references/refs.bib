  abstract = {In recent years, the exponential growth of digital documents has been met by rapid progress in text classification techniques. Newly proposed machine learning algorithms leverage the latest advancements in deep learning methods, allowing for the automatic extraction of expressive features. The swift development of these methods has led to a plethora of strategies to encode natural language into machine-interpretable data. The latest language modelling algorithms are used in conjunction with ad hoc preprocessing procedures, of which the description is often omitted in favour of a more detailed explanation of the classification step. This paper offers a concise review of recent text classification models, with emphasis on the flow of data, from raw text to output labels. We highlight the differences between earlier methods and more recent, deep learning-based methods in both their functioning and in how they transform input data. To give a better perspective on the text classification landscape, we provide an overview of datasets for the English language, as well as supplying instructions for the synthesis of two new multilabel datasets, which we found to be particularly scarce in this setting. Finally, we provide an outline of new experimental results and discuss the open research challenges posed by deep learning-based language models.},

  abstract = {In the last few years, phishing scams have rapidly grown posing huge threat to global Internet security. Today, phishing attack is one of the most common and serious threats over Internet where cyber attackers try to steal user's personal or financial credentials by using either malwares or social engineering. Detection of phishing attacks with high accuracy has always been an issue of great interest. Recent developments in phishing detection techniques have led to various new techniques, specially designed for phishing detection where accuracy is extremely important. Phishing problem is widely present as there are several ways to carry out such an attack, which implies that one solution is not adequate to address it. Two main issues are addressed in our paper. First, we discuss in detail phishing attacks, history of phishing attacks and motivation of attacker behind performing this attack. In addition, we also provide taxonomy of various types of phishing attacks. Second, we provide taxonomy of various solutions proposed in the literature to detect and defend from phishing attacks. In addition, we also discuss various issues and challenges faced in dealing with phishing attacks and spear phishing and how phishing is now targeting the emerging domain of IoT. We discuss various tools and datasets that are used by the researchers for the evaluation of their approaches. This provides better understanding of the problem, current solution space and future research scope to efficiently deal with such attacks.},

  abstract = {Spam emails have been traditionally seen as just annoying and unsolicited emails containing advertisements, but they increasingly include scams, malware or phishing. In order to ensure the security and integrity for the users, organisations and researchers aim to develop robust filters for spam email detection. Recently, most spam filters based on machine learning algorithms published in academic journals report very high performance, but users are still reporting a rising number of frauds and attacks via spam emails. Two main challenges can be found in this field: (a) it is a very dynamic environment prone to the dataset shift problem and (b) it suffers from the presence of an adversarial figure, i.e. the spammer. Unlike classical spam email reviews, this one is particularly focused on the problems that this constantly changing environment poses. Moreover, we analyse the different spammer strategies used for contaminating the emails, and we review the state-of-the-art techniques to develop filters based on machine learning. Finally, we empirically evaluate and present the consequences of ignoring the matter of dataset shift in this practical field. Experimental results show that this shift may lead to severe degradation in the estimated generalisation performance, with error rates reaching values up to \$\$48.81{\textbackslash}\%\$\$.},

This survey paper describes a focused literature survey of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) methods for intelligent spam email detection, which we believe can help in developing appropriate countermeasures. In this paper, we considered 4 parts in the email's structure that can be used for intelligent analysis: (A) Headers Provide Routing Information, contain mail transfer agents (MTA) that provide information like email and IP address of each sender and recipient of where the email originated and what stopovers, and final destination. (B) The SMTP Envelope, containing mail exchangers' identification, originating source and destination domains{\textbackslash}users. (C) First part of SMTP Data, containing information like from, to, date, subject - appearing in most email clients (D) Second part of SMTP Data, containing email body including text content, and attachment. Based on the number the relevance of an emerging intelligent method, papers representing each method were identified, read, and summarized. Insightful findings, challenges and research problems are disclosed in this paper. This comprehensive survey paves the way for future research endeavors addressing theoretical and empirical aspects related to intelligent spam email detection.},

  abstract = {Every year, phishing results in losses of billions of dollars and is a major threat to the Internet economy. Phishing attacks are now most often carried out by email. To better comprehend the existing research trend of phishing email detection, several review studies have been performed. However, it is important to assess this issue from different perspectives. None of the surveys have ever comprehensively studied the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for detection of phishing except one that shed light on the use of NLP techniques for classification and training purposes, while exploring a few alternatives. To bridge the gap, this study aims to systematically review and synthesise research on the use of NLP for detecting phishing emails. Based on specific predefined criteria, a total of 100 research articles published between 2006 and 2022 were identified and analysed. We study the key research areas in phishing email detection using NLP, machine learning algorithms used in phishing detection email, text features in phishing emails, datasets and resources that have been used in phishing emails, and the evaluation criteria. The findings include that the main research area in phishing detection studies is feature extraction and selection, followed by methods for classifying and optimizing the detection of phishing emails. Amongst the range of classification algorithms, support vector machines (SVMs) are heavily utilised for detecting phishing emails. The most frequently used NLP techniques are found to be TF-IDF and word embeddings. Furthermore, the most commonly used datasets for benchmarking phishing email detection methods is the Nazario phishing corpus. Also, Python is the most commonly used one for phishing email detection. It is expected that the findings of this paper can be helpful for the scientific community, especially in the field of NLP application in cybersecurity problems. This survey also is unique in the sense that it relates works to their openly available tools and resources. The analysis of the presented works revealed that not much work had been performed on Arabic language phishing emails using NLP techniques. Therefore, many open issues are associated with Arabic phishing email detection.},

There are, however, several forms of Naive Bayes, something the anti-spam literature does not always acknowledge. We discuss five different versions of Naive Bayes, and compare them on six new, non-encoded datasets, that contain ham messages of particular Enron users and fresh spam messages. The new datasets, which we make publicly available, are more realistic than previous comparable benchmarks, because they maintain the tempo- ral order of the messages in the two categories, and they emulate the varying proportion of spam and ham messages that users receive over time. We adopt an experimental procedure that emulates the incremental training of person- alized spam filters, and we plot roc curves that allow us to compare the different versions of nb over the entire tradeoff between true positives and true negatives.}
